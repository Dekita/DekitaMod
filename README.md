### DekitaMod
An example c++ mod for ue4ss showing how to hook into a function defined within a blueprint function library, read the input parameters, and also edit the return parameters. Also shows how to scan loaded AActors for a specific interface class, and then hook into the interface functions on the actor to trigger the relevant events in the actors blueprint :heart:
